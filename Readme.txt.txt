Test World.unity has Matthew Marine's assets (in folder marinemr Assets) and a demo level.

The platforms are saved in the folder called prefabs.  Just drag and drop them into the level.

The player is also a prefab so that it can be imported into other levels.

There is a sample enemy included to show how to enemies can be implemented.  Add the appropriate classes onto it to determine how the enemy acts.  The jumpable variable states whether or not the enemy can be killed by jumping on it (although it only tests collisions right now)
